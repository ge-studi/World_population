🌐 World Population Analysis

A data analysis project built using Streamlit to analyze world population data, identify trends, and visualize insights using various data visualization techniques.

🚀 Project Overview

This project processes and analyzes world population data, cleans the data, and visualizes key insights using bar plots, histograms, and heatmaps.
The data is obtained from a dataset named World_population_messy.csv, which contains information about countries, populations, area sizes, and population densities.

🛠️ Features

Data Cleaning: Handles missing values, corrects typos, and converts data types.

Data Visualization:

Top 10 most populated countries.

Top 10 least populated countries.

Countries with the highest and lowest population densities.

Countries with the highest and lowest growth rates.

Country rank distribution.

Correlation heatmap for numeric features.

Export Cleaned Data: Saves the cleaned dataset as world_population_cleaned.csv.

🔧 Setup and Installation

✅ 1. Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/ge-studi/World_population.git
cd World_population

✅ 2. Create a Virtual Environment:

python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Mac/Linux
env\Scripts\activate     # On Windows

✅ 3. Install Dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

🚀 Running the Application

Ensure that you are in the project directory.

Run the Streamlit app:

streamlit run app.py

Open the browser and navigate to the provided URL, typically:
http://localhost:8501

🛠️ Required Dependencies:

The required dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file.

Some key libraries include:

streamlit - for building the web app.

pandas - for data processing.

numpy - for numerical operations.

matplotlib - for data visualization.

seaborn - for advanced visualizations.

⚡ How It Works:

The data cleaning pipeline handles missing values, corrects typos, and converts columns to appropriate data types.

The cleaned dataset is saved as world_population_cleaned.csv.

The Streamlit app displays the visualizations generated using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

The user can interact with the visualizations to observe trends and patterns in population data.

📦 Deployment on Streamlit Cloud:

Create a new repository on GitHub.

Push the project files to the repository.

Go to Streamlit Cloud and connect your GitHub repository.

Deploy the app by selecting the app.py file.
